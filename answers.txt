1.) A.) forall(A,B) ParentOf(A,B) -> AncestorOf(A,B)
	B.) forall(A,B) Siblings(A,B) -> Siblings(B,A)
	C.) forall(A,B) AncestorOf(B,A) -> (forall(C) AncestorOf(C,B) -> AncestorOf(C,A))
	D.) forall(A,B,C,D) ParentOf(A,B) & ParentOf(C,D) & Siblings(A,C) -> Cousins(B,D)
	E.) forall(A,B) BloodRelated(A,B) -> BloodRelated(B,A)
	F.) forall(A,B) AncestorOf(A,B) -> BloodRelated(A,B)
	G.) forall(A,B) BloodRelated(A,B) -> (forall(C) AncestorOf(C,B) -> BloodRelated(A,C))
	
3.) This knowledge base is relatively simple to prepositionalize because the base
	statements from question one are relatively simple statements. That is, there aren't
	a lot of nested statements inside of them and they are generally only one thing
	implies another.
	
	This knowledge base is simple to run inference on because most of the statement are 
	one thing implies one other thing, and the implications chain together. Also the left
	sides of the implication are relatively simple, meaning no combinatorial explosion
	results from running the implication algorithm.
